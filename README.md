## scitos_cmd_vel_mux

This package provides a launch and parameter file that is tailored to a scitos A5 robot using the navigation stack and a teleoperation node like `scitos_teleop`.

### Installation
* Run `catkin_make`
* Run dependencies are installed via rosdep.

### Usage
* Run
```
roslaunch scitos_cmd_vel_mux mux.launch
```
* Remap your navigation stack `/cmd_vel` output to `/cmd_vel_mux/input/navigation`
* Run
```
roslaunch scitos_teleop_mux.launch
```
  This remaps the joystick output to `/cmd_vel_mux/input/joystick` and now the joystick will always have priority as soon as you press the dead-man-switch. Or you can run any other teleoperation node and do the remapping yourself.
