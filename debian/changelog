ros-hydro-scitos-docking (0.0.1-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * [scitos_ptu] release preparations.
  * [scitos_docking] Realease preparation
    * Moved header files to include
    * Created proper directories
    * Created install targets
    * Cleaned package.xml
    * Added license
  * added opencv2
  * added libncurses-dev as dependency
  * [scitos_door_pass] Removed double dependencies and added move_base_msgs to package.xml
  * Charging action and service is now part of the scitos_docking package.
  * Moved action_buttons message to scitos_teleop package.
  * Renamed ros_datacentre to mongodb_store
    This simply bulk replaces all ros_datacentre strings to mongodb_store strings inside files and also in file names.
    Needs strands-project/ros_datacentre#76 <https://github.com/strands-project/ros_datacentre/issues/76> to me merged first.
  * adding machine tags to cmd_vel_mux, teleop_joystick and scitos docking launch files
  * Merge pull request #82 <https://github.com/strands-project/scitos_apps/issues/82> from gestom/hydro-devel

  * Charging now split into three action servers: docking, undocking and chargingServer. ChargingServer can dock, undock, and calibrate depending on the command it receives. Docking and undocking servers receive MoveBase goal, so they can be integrated in Topological navigation.
  * Using the ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS} macro in all the add_dependencies statements now.
  * Changed bracketing to fix compilation error.
  * Switched strands_datacentre to ros_datacentre in here
  * Merge pull request #50 <https://github.com/strands-project/scitos_apps/issues/50> from hawesie/master
    Linking changes for OSX
  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/hawesie/scitos_apps
  * Should fix the dependency problem for the data_centre
  * added dependency for datacentre
  * OS X linking
  * Dependencies of CPtuClient
  * Linking changes for OSX
  * Docking position injection improvement.
  * Minor issue with position injection timestamp.
  * Attempt to resolve the undocking simulation failure.
  * Merge pull request #31 <https://github.com/strands-project/scitos_apps/issues/31> from hawesie/master
    Seems to work OK.
  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/hawesie/scitos_apps into hawesie-master
  * Position injection into AMCL after undocking.
  * Dependecy bug corrected.
  * Publishing after preemption suppressed.
  * Charging in the dark
  * Added MongoDB support to store calibration params. Corrected reports on success or failure. Command multiplexer made optional.
  * Linking commands necessary for OS X.
  * A potential bug, which caused the visual charging to fail in simulation, has been removed. Moreover, the undocking now starts with slowly opening the eyes. That gives the users some time to leave the area behind the robot.
  * A potential bug, which caused the visual charging to fail in simulation, has been removed. Moreover, the undocking now starts with slowly opening the eyes. That gives the users some time to leave the area behind the robot.
  * Added missing instruction.
  * Updated documentation to cover actionlib.
  * Added dependencies to CMakeLists, extended the testing mode of visual charging
  * Test script modification.
  * Test script modified.
  * Calibration params now saved to /.charging.yaml. Code rewritted towards human redability. Docking/undocking can be initiated by joystick button X. Controller speed-up. Added test mode for automated trials and a test script.
  * Docs update
  * Documentation update.
    Removed redundant files.
  * Added a client for testing, modified messages to report on progress and implemented simple self-diagnostic.
  * Charging process now an actionlib server.
  * Calibration parameters now saved in etc/charging.yaml, so calibration has to be performed only once.
  * Minor changes to robot controllers.
  * Solving compatibility issues with simulator.
  * Explicit stop when waiting for charger signal.
  * Rotation of the robot stopped after undocking and charging.
  * Charging rejected on missing calibration parameters.
  * No charging attempted without proper calibration params.
  * Bug in retreival of camera parameters resolved.
  * Stop command send explicitly after the docking or undocking terminates.
    Camera parameters can be changed on the fly.
  * Small improvements to docking code.
  * CMalelist improved to conform with source name change.
  * Image processing now running on monochromatic image.
  * Towards compatibility with the MORSE simulator:
    1) Listening to Battery state rather than Charging status.
    2) Image processing modified to include alpha channel processing.x
  * Documentation added.
  * Undocking + improvements to increase docking success rate.
  * Added a robot station label.
    Updated a readme file.
  * rosdep fixed for gsl
  * Added gsl find and linking for compile on osx.
  * fixed a renaming bug.
  * Some urgent restructuring and adding of dependencies to make it build again.
  * command now precedes timeout
  * Solving compilation issues with scitos_messages.
  * Cleanup.
  * First verstion of the docking.
