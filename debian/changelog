ros-indigo-scitos-touch (0.0.1-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * [scitos_touch] resetting version number.
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' into dependencies
    Conflicts:
    scitos_door_pass/CMakeLists.txt
    scitos_door_pass/package.xml
    scitos_teleop/CMakeLists.txt
    scitos_teleop/package.xml
  * Fixing the maintainer and author entries in package xml files that I am involved in.
  * [scitos_touch] Added std_msgs to CMakeLists
  * Added license file
  * [scitos_touch] Prerelease cleanup
  * Using the ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS} macro in all the add_dependencies statements now.
  * ifdef to remove boost join parse error.
  * Bug fix:
    Do not use own nodehandle but use getNodeHandle to let rqt take care of your subscribers.
  * changed initial motor state assumption to motors are running.
  * start with assumption that motors are off in the beginning.
  * Added some comments and deleted rubbish from package.xml
  * Bug fixing:
    forgot to start the ros:spin thread and had to add a ! for the colour change
    The button is now a bit smaller to be able to use something else besides the button in rqt.
    The colour is now only changed if there is real change in the value.
  * Complete restructuring.
    Getting rid of ros_comm because it is not needed and complicates erverything.
  * Missing connect function added to give some functionality to the button.
  * Remodeling the emergency stop button into an rqt plugin.
    First attempt. Limited functionality.
  * Added documentation.
  * added scitos_msgs_genccp dependency.
  * Fixed dependencies and removed "glob"-ing from CMakeLists to make it clean.
  * Button toggle is now based on service success.
  * Listening to the /bumper topic to determine the real state of the motors instead of guessing from service success.
  * Making Qt stop gracefully when catching sigint or sigterm.
    Calling ros::shutdown when Qt app quits.
  * Button now changes colour when pressed and motors are successfully stopped.
  * bug fix.
  * Toggle between emergency stop and reset motors.
  * First working version. Should stop motors on button press. Still not clean. Segfaults when closed because ros::spin is not properly terminated yet.
  * Base framework for a touchscreen emergency stop button. No funtionality yet.
  * Contributors: Christian Dondrup, Nick Hawes, cdondrup
